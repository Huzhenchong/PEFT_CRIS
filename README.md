# PEFT_CRIS

Thanks for [DerrickWang005](https://github.com/DerrickWang005/CRIS.pytorch). I fine-turned their model with prompt learning and adapters. The model can run with less than 8GB memory.<img><img>
see [master](https://github.com/Huzhenchong/PEFT_CRIS/tree/master) to download the model files and follow [readme](https://github.com/DerrickWang005/CRIS.pytorch/blob/master/README.md) to run the model
